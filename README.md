# Metaheuristics

This is simply a note that recognizes a bunch of metaheuristics that Iâ€™ve come across throughout my research. This may be of use when attempting to discover new variants or successors. If you want your algorithm posted here please email me (link on github profile).

## Particle Swarm Optimizers (PSO)
- Original PSO: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968
- Original PSO w/ Inertia: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1998.699146

### Cooperative

Known for working well for large-scale optimization problems. May need to consider variable dependencies when splitting dimensionality.

- DCPSO, MCPSO: https://doi.org/10.1145/3206185.3206199
- RG-DCPSO, RG-MCPSO: submitted but in review.
